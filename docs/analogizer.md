# The Analogizer

[Analogizer](https://github.com/RndMnkIII/Analogizer) is RndMnkIII's adapter
for the Pocket's cartridge slot. It gives analog video out of a VGA connector
(RGBS, RGsB, YPbPr, Y/C, and a scandoubled RGBHV) and takes native controllers
through SNAC adapters. Its wiki is the authority on the adapter itself:
[specifications](https://github.com/RndMnkIII/Analogizer/wiki/Analogizer-Specifications),
[how to configure it](https://github.com/RndMnkIII/Analogizer/wiki/Supported-Cores-and-How-to-Configure-Them).

Every core built from this template supports it out of the box
(`USE_ANALOGIZER = 1` in `core_top.sv`). This page is what to change for your
board, what to tell the player, and what has been proven. A core's copy should
replace the template's numbers with its own; the places are marked **SET**.
For a core NOT built from this template, `docs/analogizer-retrofit.md` is the
step-by-step.

## For the player

**Settings are in the core's own menu**, under the game's other options,
like RndMnkIII's own "Pocket Menu" Analogizer cores (the wiki's list calls the
other kind, which reads a shared `analogizer.bin`, "Analogizer File"; a core
from this template does not read that file). The Pocket remembers them per
core.

| entry | options |
|---|---|
| Analogizer | Off (the default), On, On, Pocket off (the picture goes to the CRT only) |
| Analogizer Video | RGBS, RGsB, YPbPr, Y/C NTSC, Y/C PAL, Scandoubler, Scandoubler 25% / 50% / 75%, Scandoubler HQ2x |
| SNAC Adapter | None, DB15, NES, SNES, PCE 2-button, PCE 6-button, PCE Multitap, DB15 Fast, SNES A,B<->X,Y, PSX Digital, PSX Digital Fast, PSX Analog, PSX Analog Fast |
| SNAC Assignment | the six below |

With **Analogizer** off the core behaves exactly as it did without Analogizer
support. The adapter itself is set up as its wiki's
[How to use it](https://github.com/RndMnkIII/Analogizer/wiki/How-to-use-it%3F)
says: SNAC switch in position A, 5 V into its USB-C port, the SCART cable's
audio jack in the Pocket's headphone socket.

**Video.** The core sends the board's own signal, at the board's own line
and frame rate -- the timing a 15 kHz arcade monitor or a PVM expects. (**SET**
the numbers in the core's copy: the skeleton's is 320 × 224 visible, 452 × 253
dots at 6.857 MHz, 15.17 kHz, 59.96 Hz.)

| mode | SOG switch | notes |
|---|---|---|
| RGBS | off | VGA-to-SCART or VGA-to-BNC |
| RGsB | on | R2/R3 adapters only |
| YPbPr | on | R2/R3 adapters only |
| Y/C NTSC, Y/C PAL | off | needs an active Y/C adapter on the VGA port |
| SC 0% / 25% / 50% / 75% / HQ2x | off | scandoubled for a VGA monitor: twice the line rate |

"On, Pocket off" turns the Pocket's own picture black while the CRT keeps
it.

**Controllers.** SNAC pads (DB15, NES, SNES, PC Engine 2/6-button and
multitap, PlayStation) replace the Pocket's controls according to the
**SNAC Assignment** chosen in the menu:

| assignment | player 1 | player 2 | player 3 | player 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SNAC P1 → Pocket P1 | SNAC 1 | the Pocket's own controls | dock 3 | dock 4 |
| SNAC P1 → Pocket P2 | Pocket | SNAC 1 | dock 3 | dock 4 |
| SNAC P1,P2 → P1,P2 | SNAC 1 | SNAC 2 | dock 3 | dock 4 |
| SNAC P1,P2 → P2,P1 | SNAC 2 | SNAC 1 | dock 3 | dock 4 |
| SNAC P1,P2 → P3,P4 | Pocket | dock 2 | SNAC 1 | SNAC 2 |
| SNAC P1-P4 → P1-P4 | SNAC 1 | SNAC 2 | SNAC 3 | SNAC 4 |

Four SNAC players need the PC Engine multitap. A pad's buttons arrive as the
Pocket's own (SNAC's A is the Pocket's A, and so on), so they do whatever the
core maps those to. A PlayStation pad in analog mode steers with its left
stick.

**Cart power is on for everyone.** `core.json` declares the cartridge adapter,
so the Pocket powers the slot whether or not an Analogizer is in it. Do not
leave a game cartridge in the slot while this core runs.

Say in the core's README whether it has been tried on an Analogizer. What
the bench proves is listed under *What was measured* below. Send problems with
the adapter itself to the Analogizer project.

## For the developer

### The pieces

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `target/pocket/analogizer/` | RndMnkIII's `openFPGA_Pocket_Analogizer` and what it instantiates, **verbatim** (modules/VENDOR.md has the commit). Its `analogizer.qip` is ours: only what is used. |
| `target/pocket/pocket_analogizer.sv` | the wrapper: clock hand-over, Y/C constants, SNAC → controller words. Core-agnostic; the same file in the template. |
| `target/pocket/core_top.sv` | `USE_ANALOGIZER`, the instance (after the bring-up panel; **SET** its `LINE_LEN`), `key1..key4` in place of `cont1..4_key`, the bridge read at `0xF7xxxxxx`, the Pocket-screen blank, and the cart pins' idle levels when it is off. |
| `core_pll` `outclk_4` | the Analogizer's 48 MHz, `clk_sys / 2` in phase; in the SDC's PLL group. |
| `pkg/.../interact.json` | the four entries above, ids 70–73, each a masked field of the word at `0xF7000000`. The enable and the Pocket-screen blank share one entry to keep the skeleton's menu inside the 14 entries any installed core has (`tools/check_json.py`); a core that drops the bring-up entries has room to split them |
| `pkg/.../core.json` | `"cartridge_adapter": 0` (powers the slot) |
| `sim/run_analogizer.sh` | the bench (below); **SET** the raster at the top of `sim/tb_analogizer.sv` |
| `tools/check_json.py` | fails if an entry writes outside its mask, none sets the enable, a data slot also writes `0xF7000000`, or the slot is not powered |

### The settings word

One 32-bit word at `0xF7000000`, the layout RndMnkIII's adapter module (1.4)
decodes. Each menu entry is a list with a mask that keeps every bit but its
own field (or fields), so the four entries share the word:

| bits | field | values |
|---|---|---|
| 4:0 | SNAC type | 0 none, 1 DB15, 2 NES, 3 SNES, 4 PCE 2-button, 5 PCE 6-button, 6 PCE multitap, 9 DB15 fast, 0xB SNES A/B↔X/Y, 0xC–0xF PS/2 keyboard (+ pad; not in the menu, the wrapper does not wire the keyboard out), 0x10/0x11 PSX digital (125/250 kHz), 0x12/0x13 PSX analog. 16 and up select the adapter's B wiring. |
| 5 | enable | 0: the port stays idle and nothing else applies |
| 9:6 | SNAC assignment | 0–5 as in the table above |
| 13:10 | video | 0 RGBS, 1 RGsB, 2 YPbPr, 3 Y/C NTSC, 4 Y/C PAL, 5–9 scandoubler 0/25/50/75%/HQ2x |
| 14 | blank the Pocket screen | |
| 15 | OSD on the Analogizer output | not used by the template; no menu entry |

**Read-back.** The word is written as a number (the adapter module is told
`bridge_endian_little = 1`, so it does not byte-swap it as it would a file),
and `pocket_analogizer` keeps its own copy to read back, combinationally.
The Pocket's bridge (`io_bridge_peripheral.sv`) samples read data four clocks
after it presents the address and pulses `bridge_rd` only afterwards; the
adapter module updates its read-back on that pulse, so it would hand back
the *previous* read's value. If the firmware merges a masked entry by
reading the word, that stale value would wipe the other fields: in the
bench, choosing a video mode turned the Analogizer off. RndMnkIII's menu
cores (Gauntlet) read the word back the same way, from a register.

**The file scheme, not used here.** The adapter module 1.4 was written for
`analogizer.bin`, a file Pupdate and AnalogizerConfigurator write to
`/Assets/analogizer/common/`, loaded through a data slot at the same address.
It needs a data slot naming the file, a second platform id `analogizer`
that the slot's parameters point at, and the file on the card before the
adapter does anything. A player who has never heard of the file has an
Analogizer that stays dark, so the template uses the menu. A data slot at
`0xF7000000` would load the file over the menu's word; `tools/check_json.py`
refuses one.

### Clocks

`openFPGA_Pocket_Analogizer` runs its logic on `i_clk`, puts `video_clk` on the
cartridge pin that clocks the ADV7123, and assumes that is `i_clk` too. The
scandoubler halves the pixel period, so the clock has to be at least four
times the dot rate. The shipped Analogizer cores use 42.95–48 MHz. The
template's system clock is 96 MHz, which is more than the cart's level
translators have been asked to pass, so the PLL's spare output gives 48 MHz,
in phase with `clk_sys`. `pocket_analogizer` takes each pixel `PIX_LAG` (2)
system clocks after the dot enable into a holding register and hands it over
with a toggle. The Analogizer side picks it up two or three of its clocks
later, well inside the dot. A core whose `clk_sys` is already 40–50 MHz can
pass `clk_sys` as both clocks. A core with an unrelated video clock can too,
because the hand-over is a proper synchroniser, but the SDC then needs the two
in separate asynchronous groups.

The Y/C encoder's subcarrier step and colour-burst window are computed in
integers from `CLK_HZ`. The reals used elsewhere lose the bits past 32 in some
tools, and MSX2's hand-typed NTSC step is a few counts off.

### Using SNAC in the game's inputs

`pocket_analogizer` outputs `key1..key4`, the Pocket's controller words with
SNAC pads put in place by the assignment. SNAC's bit order is the Pocket's
(0 up, 1 down, 2 left, 3 right, 4 A, 5 B, 6 X, 7 Y, 8 L1, 9 R1, … 14 select,
15 start). They feed the `gamepad` helper and the direct player-3/4 reads in
place of `cont1..4_key`. **Wherever a core reads `cont*_key` directly**
(players 3 and 4 often are), read `key*` instead, or SNAC will not reach it.

### What was measured

- `sim/run_analogizer.sh`: the wrapper and the vendored module at the
  skeleton's raster and clocks, read at the cartridge pins as the DAC reads
  them. It passes at both the skeleton's raster (7 Analogizer clocks a dot)
  and Moo Mesa's (512 × 264, 6 clocks a dot), where it was first written.
  - With the menu at its defaults, every pin sits as on a core without the
    adapter, and the controller words pass through.
  - Every option of every Analogizer entry in the package's `interact.json`
    (32), set as the firmware sets a masked entry, read back the word as the
    bridge samples it, merged and written: the word, the adapter's copy and
    the enable each followed. With the adapter's own read-back in place of
    the wrapper's, the same run fails at the second entry.
  - RGBS: all 71,680 visible dots of a frame reach the DAC pins, in raster
    order, as their top six bits per channel, with 0 differing. Csync is one
    hsync-long pulse a line.
  - Scandoubler: 506 lines per frame (twice 253) at 1582 clocks, half the
    core's line.
  - YPbPr and Y/C NTSC/PAL: no unknown on any pin for a frame.
  - All six SNAC assignments, the analog stick, and type "none" map as
    tabled.
  - The blank bit, and enable off again returning the port to idle.
- `sim/lint.sh`: the wrapper lints clean. The vendored files' warnings are
  dropped by path; their errors are not.
- Quartus: Moo Mesa compiles and closes timing with it, at a cost of 1,550
  ALMs, 13 RAM blocks and 2 DSP blocks. The template's own build is in the
  commit that added this.

**Not proven:** anything on hardware with a core from this template (the
adapter module itself ships in RndMnkIII's cores and in plasticbugs' MSX2),
and the SNAC serial protocols, which are
the adapter module's and are forced at its outputs in the bench rather than
driven over the pins. The Y/C and YPbPr encodings have no reference to compare
against, only a run without unknowns.

### Turning it off

Set `USE_ANALOGIZER = 0` in `core_top.sv`, remove `general[4]` from the PLL
group in the SDC (it would match nothing), and take the four menu entries
and `cartridge_adapter: 0` out of the JSON.
