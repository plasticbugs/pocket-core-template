# Publish a release built from a specific, hardware-verified CI build.
#
# Usage: cut-release.sh <tag> <run-id | bitstream.rbf_r>
#        cut-release.sh v1.0.0 32214080417
#        cut-release.sh v1.0.0 release/pocket/Cores/<id>/bitstream.rbf_r
#
# Takes the bitstream from that CI run, or the local file that was flashed,
# rather than recompiling, so the release ships the exact gateware that was
# tested on hardware. Everything outside the
# bitstream (JSON definitions, platform image, ROM recipe, README) comes from
# the working tree, which is how a definition-only change can be released
# without a rebuild.
#
# Creating the tag triggers the Compile Core workflow; it sees the release
# already exists and skips publishing, leaving this artifact in place.
